Hi,



1. If anyone would like to have a private conversation, then Ollama is for you, and one could use Ollama and download any available AI model. 
   Just be sure of two things: you have the Ollama on Aeroplane mode to prevent Internet access to your query, and you also have Network Expose turned off to refuse requests from other devices.



2. Now, to the CS students out there, if you would like to use Claude entirely for free, with no API Billing and CLI Billing. 
   I want you to know that Claude is known for its programming performance, and along with the private mode that will not be exposed to the public network, bear with me.



This is for Windows PowerShell 7 (x64) admin mode, by the way :



1. a)winget install --id=Ollama.Ollama -e

   b)ollama run gpt-oss:20b (This one is 14GB only)



2. a)irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

   b)$env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="ollama"

     $env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"

     npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code --model gpt-oss:20b (Put your Model name here)
